# Security Governance Overview

## Purpose
This document defines the security governance principles that underpin the Enterprise Security Baseline project.

Effective security governance ensures that security controls are consistently applied, risks are understood, and accountability is clearly defined across an organisation.

## Security Principles
- Least privilege
- Defence in depth
- Secure by design
- Continuous improvement
- Shared responsibility

## Risk Ownership
Security risk is owned by the business and managed through collaboration between:
- Engineering teams
- Security functions
- Risk and compliance stakeholders

Clear ownership ensures that security decisions are deliberate, documented, and aligned with business objectives.

## Policy and Standards Alignment
The guidance in this repository aligns with recognised standards including:
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO/IEC 27001

## Governance in Practice
Security governance should be:
- Embedded into system design
- Integrated with change management
- Supported by measurable controls and regular review
