# Security Governance Overview

## Purpose
This document defines the security governance principles that underpin the Enterprise Security Baseline project.

Effective security governance ensures that security controls are consistently applied, risks are understood, and accountability is clearly defined across an organisation.

## Security Principles
- Least privilege
- Defence in depth
- Secure by design
- Continuous improvement
- Shared responsibility

## Risk Ownership
Security risk is owned by the business and managed through collaboration between:
- Engineering teams
- Security functions
- Risk and compliance stakeholders

Clear ownership ensures that security decisions are deliberate, documented, and aligned with business objectives.

## Policy and Standards Alignment
The guidance in this repository aligns with recognised standards including:
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO/IEC 27001

## Governance in Practice
Security governance should be:
- Embedded into system design
- Integrated with change management
- Supported by measurable controls and regular review

## Security Governance Operating Model

Security governance within the enterprise operates on a **three-line accountability model** to ensure effective oversight, execution, and independent assurance.

### First Line: Operational Ownership
- Business units and engineering teams own security risks within their domains
- Secure-by-design principles are embedded into daily operations
- Teams are accountable for implementing approved security controls

### Second Line: Security & Risk Oversight
- Information Security defines policies, standards, and minimum baselines
- Risk assessments are conducted to evaluate control effectiveness
- Exceptions are reviewed, approved, documented, and time-bound

### Third Line: Independent Assurance
- Internal audit or independent reviewers assess governance effectiveness
- Findings are tracked to remediation with executive visibility
- Governance outcomes inform continuous improvement

## Policy Lifecycle and Control Authority

All security policies and standards follow a controlled lifecycle to ensure relevance, accountability, and enforceability.

### Policy Lifecycle
1. Drafted by Information Security
2. Reviewed by Legal, Risk, and Technology stakeholders
3. Approved by Executive or Governance Committee
4. Communicated and enforced across the organisation
5. Reviewed annually or upon significant change

### Control Authority
- Policies define *what* must be achieved
- Standards define *how* controls are implemented
- Procedures define *who* executes and maintains controls

## Risk Acceptance and Exception Management

Not all security risks can be immediately mitigated. Where exceptions are required, a formal risk acceptance process is enforced.

### Exception Requirements
- Documented business justification
- Defined compensating controls
- Risk owner approval
- Expiry date and review trigger

### Oversight
- Exceptions are centrally logged
- High-risk exceptions require executive approval
- Repeated exceptions trigger root cause analysis

## Governance Metrics and Reporting

Security governance effectiveness is measured using both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

### Example Metrics
- Policy compliance rates
- Open high-risk exceptions
- Time to remediate audit findings
- Security training completion rates

### Reporting Cadence
- Monthly operational reporting
- Quarterly executive governance updates
- Annual board-level security review

## Alignment with Enterprise Objectives

Security governance supports enterprise objectives by:
- Enabling regulatory compliance
- Reducing operational and financial risk
- Supporting secure digital transformation
- Preserving customer trust and organisational reputation
